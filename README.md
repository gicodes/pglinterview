Supervised by Mr. James.

## Description

Simple CRUD app written with Express, Node.js and JSON.

## How to Start App

From your terminal, cd into the working directory `pglinterview`

Run `npm start` - app uses nodemon, so it auto restarts after any changes

The server should have started. Go to your browser and open `localhost:4000`

Any error that occurs should be displayed on the web page or seen on the terminal.
